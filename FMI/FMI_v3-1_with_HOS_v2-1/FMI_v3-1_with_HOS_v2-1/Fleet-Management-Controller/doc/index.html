About the Fleet Management Controller</h1>
<p>The Fleet Management Controller is a sample implementation of a server as defined by the Fleet Management Interface Control Specification (001-00096-00) Rev. H, and is provided for evaluation and testing of Fleet Management features, as well as a starting point and reference for those developing Fleet Management solutions that conform to the Interface Control Specification.</p>
<p>In addition to the software, a Garmin client device supporting FMI and the appropriate FMI cable are required. For instructions on assembling a serial cable to connect to a PC serial port, see <a href="http://www.garmin.com/specs/pcwiring.pdf">http://www.garmin.com/specs/pcwiring.pdf</a>. The wire color assignments for the 010-10865-00 and 010-10813-00 FMI cables are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow: Data Out (DB9 pin 2),</li>
<li>White: Data In (DB9 pin 3),</li>
<li>Black: Ground (DB9 pin 5).</li>
</ul>
<p>The wire color assignments for the 010-11232-00 FMI cable is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yellow: Data Out (DB9 pin 2),</li>
<li>White: Data In (DB9 pin 3),</li>
<li>Brown: Ground (DB9 pin 5).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of any discrepancies between the Fleet Management Interface Control Specification and this sample application (in documentation, behavior, or otherwise) the Fleet Management Interface Control Specification shall be considered the authoritative reference.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="theory"></a>
Theory of Operation</h1>
<p>The application is implemented in C++ as a single-threaded MFC application, and communicates with a single client over a direct serial link.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="startup"></a>
Startup</h2>
<p>The program starts up by initializing all data saved from the last execution of the program. This data is saved in various save files controlled by the <a class="el" href="classFileBackedMap.html" title="Map whose contents are also saved to a file.">FileBackedMap</a> template class (namely: canned_messages.dat, canned_responses.dat, sent_canned_response_messages.dat, driver_status.dat, a603_stops.dat, categories.dat, waypoints.dat drivers.dat). If any of these files are not present or empty, the associated data structures will also be empty (which is fine).</p>
<p>Upon connection to the client, the client may send refresh requests to the server (this application) to update the canned message list, canned response list, and driver status list. Stops and throttled protocols are not refreshed on startup; they are refreshed when the corresponding monitor dialog is opened.</p>
<p>The stop data structure is the only one that cannot be read in and assumed to be up to date, since stops can be updated or deleted when the client is not connected to the server. To handle this, stop updates are requested for all stops in the stop save file. When the stop data structures are set up correctly, receiving a deleted stop update will delete that ID from the stop list and also move any stops below it up. However, on startup there may be stops that have not been initialized yet (in other words, the server cannot be sure of the index in the list). To solve this problem, a flag is set to tell the Communication (Com) that the stop list is not initialized. With this flag set, the update process is modified. It ignores all updates except deletes, and then only removes the stop from the save file and from the ID list. To fully initialize the stop list, the server sends out two waves of updates. The first is sent for all stops in the save file with the initialized flag set to false (update process modified). This will get rid of all deleted stop updates and solve the problem. Whenever the user requests the stop list dialog for the first time, the initialized flag is set to true (update process set back to normal) and another wave of updates are sent for the IDs remaining in the stop ID list. This time the server will update the status and index in the stop list for all valid stops.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="comm"></a>
Communication Protocol</h2>
<p>Communication is implemented in a layered manner; the details of each layeer are in a separate class: <a class="el" href="classSerialPort.html" title="Physical layer implementation for a serial port.">SerialPort</a> is the physical layer. It reads and writes bytes from the RS232 port. <a class="el" href="classLinkLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for link Layers in the OSI model.">LinkLayer</a> is the next layer up. It takes the bytes received from the serial port and builds them into frames, sending NAK and ACK packets in response. It also takes packets sent by the transport layer and builds them into a stream of bytes by assembling the packet and adding the header (DLE), footer (DLE-ETX) and DLE-stuffing the data. <a class="el" href="classTransportLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for transport layer in the OSI model.">TransportLayer</a> is the next layer up. It processes received ACK and NAK packets and handles timeouts; other received packets are passed up to the application layer. For packets received from the application layer, the <a class="el" href="classTransportLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for transport layer in the OSI model.">TransportLayer</a> maintains a queue of pending packets to ensure that no more than one is outstanding at a time. The <a class="el" href="classApplicationLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for the application layer in the OSI model.">ApplicationLayer</a> sends packets to the <a class="el" href="classTransportLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for transport layer in the OSI model.">TransportLayer</a> and processes the packets received from the <a class="el" href="classTransportLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for transport layer in the OSI model.">TransportLayer</a>, updates data structures appropriately, and notifies the UI when events occur.</p>
<p>The Server and client communicate using a handshaking protocol. This involves not sending any new packets out after one has been transmitted until a response is received. There are two possibilities for reponses&ndash;ACKs (successful transmission) or NAKs (unsuccessful transmission). To implement this, the last transmitted packet is left at the top of the transmit queue. When an ACK is received, the packet is removed from the queue and the next packet (if any) is sent. If a NAK is received, the <a class="el" href="classTransportLayer.html" title="Abstract base class for transport layer in the OSI model.">TransportLayer</a> resends the packet at the top of the queue. This allows the server to maintain the handshaking protocol, while maintaining a responsive user inteface and responding to received packets as they come in.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="protocol"></a>
Adherence to protocols</h2>
<p>This program has been designed to not allow the sending of packets without all of the required information (i.e. sending a A604 open text message without a message ID). If desired, it is possible to disable these checks in the application by changing the SKIP_VALIDATION define in <a class="el" href="fmi_8h.html">fmi.h</a> to TRUE, then rebuilding the app. However, this is not recommended and could result in undefined behavior on the client device. SKIP_VALIDATION should normally be left set to FALSE.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="fmi_packet"></a>
Sending Arbitrary FMI Packets</h2>
<p>The program is designed to allow easy transmission of packets without the user entering in all the header and footer associated with each packet (for example, calculating the checksum is error-prone when done by hand); however, if there is something the UI currently doesn't support, there is a means to send whatever data the user wants. In the top right hand corner of the home screen, there is a box entitled 'FMI <a class="el" href="classPacket.html" title="Abstract base class for a packet of data.">Packet</a>' with 2 fields. The ID field is the ID of the FMI packet to be sent (not 0xa1). This field requires the entry of all 4 hex digits for all 16 bits. This means the user must enter 0x0003 (with all zeros, '0x' is not required) for packet ID 3. The data field should be entered exactly as the data will be transmitted WITHOUT DLE byte stuffing. The current protocol uses little endian byte ordering so if a particular field of a packet required the 32 bit hex value of 0x12345678, the proper entry for this is 78563412 ('0x' is not required but can be used).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="logging"></a>
Logging and the Log Viewer</h2>
<p>All packets transmitted to or received from client device are logged to the file fmi_pc_app.log for analysis or debugging purposes; the program includes a log viewer which can be used to display, parse, or search the log. Logs can also be saved, and the log viewer can be opened without connecting to a client device, to view a packet log from a previous execution of the program.</p>
<p>The log file is a text file with ANSI encoding. The format of the log file is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line 1: Time when log was started, as four comma-delimited numbers (hr,mn,ss,millis).</li>
<li>Lines 2-n: Log details &ndash; Char 1: 'T' if the line represents transmitted data, 'R' if received data. &ndash; Char 2..k-1: Offset in milliseconds when this line was written. &ndash; Char k: A hyphen '-'; this is strictly a delimiter &ndash; Char k+1..m: The raw data, in hexadecimal format. For transmitted data, this is exactly one packet; for received data, this shows all data from the beginning of the packet to the end of the FIFO buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The last line of the file may not be terminated with a newline character.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="vcproj"></a>
Protocol support</h2>
<p>The program can be built in several configurations to support all protocols up to a certain identifier - A602, A603, A604, A605, or A607; this is done by wrapping code to support particular features in preprocessor if / endif blocks. Several solution configurations are provided which set up the preprocessor definitions and exclude source files as needed for each protocol level. For example, the Message Throttling Query protocol was introduced in protocol A605; the PC app support for this protocol is preceded by an if (FMI_SUPPORT_A605) and followed by an endif block. This supports testing for backward compatibility, in addition to identifying the source code relevant to the protocols introduced in each release of the Fleet Management Interface specification. Note that this is a compile-time switch; the protocol support data sent by the client device does not influence the options which are available in the program.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="unicode"></a>
Unicode support</h2>
<p>The application uses Unicode character strings within the user interface regardless of the client code page; text strings are converted to either code page 1252 (ASCII) or UTF-8 before being passed to Com, and text strings received from the client are converted from 1252 or UTF-8 to Unicode when they are displayed. The member variable Com.client_codepage tracks whether the client supports UTF-8, and the Windows API functions WideCharToMultiByte and MultiByteToWideChar are used to convert between client and server code pages.</p>
<p>It is possible to disable the Unicode Support protocol on the server by changing the define for UNICODE_SUPPORT to FALSE. This define can be found in the <a class="el" href="fmi_8h.html">fmi.h</a> header file.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="other"></a>
Other Details</h2>
<p>The other details of the implementation should be self evident, explained in the specification document, or commented in the code. </p>
